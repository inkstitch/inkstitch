# Background and Philosophy

_by @lexelby, an Ink/Stitch programmer_

I received a really wonderful christmas gift for a geeky programmer hacker: an [embroidery machine](http://www.brother-usa.com/homesewing/ModelDetail.aspx?ProductID=SE400).  It's pretty much a CNC thread-bot... I just had to figure out how to design programs for it.  The problem is, **all free embroidery design software seemed to be terrible**, especially when you add in the requirement of being able to run in Linux, my OS of choice.

I started off hacking on [inkscape-embroidery](http://www.jonh.net/~jonh/inkscape-embroidery/).  It had some of the basic capabilities I needed, and I saw a lot of potential.  I love the idea of using an existing, ultra-powerful SVG editor as the basis for an embroidery design suite.

Things took off from there.  I continued adding features as I needed them, and by this point, very little if any of the original code remains.

The goal of Ink/Stitch is to provide a powerful embroidery digitizing platform for everyone **completely free**.  I want to open up the field of embroidery design, making it approachable even for those who can't spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on software.  And I want folks like me, who love to combine code with art, to have an open, extensible, and approachable platform to hack on.
