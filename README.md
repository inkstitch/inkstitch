# inkscape-embroidery: An Inkscape plugin for designing machine embroidery patterns
## Intro
**Want to design embroidery pattern files (PES, DST, etc) using free, open source software?  Hate all the other options?  Try this one.**

I got a really wonderful christmas gift for a geeky programmer hacker: an [embroidery machine](http://www.brother-usa.com/homesewing/ModelDetail.aspx?ProductID=SE400).  It's pretty much a CNC thread-bot... I just had to figure out how to design programs for it.  The problem is, **all free embroidery design software seems to be terrible**, especially when you add in the requirement of being able to run in Linux, my OS of choice.

So I wrote one.

Okay, not really.  I'm pretty terrible at GUIs, but I found this nifty inkscape extension that was created and hacked on by a couple of other folks.  It was pretty rudimentary, but it got the job done, and more importantly, it was super hackable.  I hacked the hell out of it, and at this point **inkscape-embroidery is a viable entry-level machine embroidery design tool**.
