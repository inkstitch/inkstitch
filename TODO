- pattern fill
  - turns out this is a lot easier than I thought it was
  - just like normal fill except the stitch locations in each row are chosen to make a pattern
  - can do this by intersecting the pattern with the shape instead of just a generic grating
- curved fill
  - use radial fill in inkscape to define center and starting angle
  - the rows of stitches radiate out from a center point
    - otherwise it's just like normal fill
- start/end points for fills
  - rotation center might work for one of them, but what else can I use in inkscape's UI?
- keep stitch plan objects and just update the ones that change
  - use md5sum of `<path>` objects to see what's changed
  - keep stitch plans in a layer above everything else
  - set stitch plans to "noninteractive" so you can click through them to the paths
  - this will make it work more like a "real" embroidery program
  - separate 'export embroidery file' command
- add option for connection to next patch (jump, trim, or running stitch)
