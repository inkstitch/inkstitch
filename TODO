 * pattern-based fill?
 * curved fill?
 * keep stitch plan objects and just update the ones that change
   * use md5sum of <path> objects to see what's changed
   * keep stitch plans in a layer above everything else
   * set stitch plans to "noninteractive" so you can click through them to the paths
   * this will make it work more like a "real" embroidery program
   * separate 'export embroidery file' command
 * add option for connection to next patch (jump or running stitch)
