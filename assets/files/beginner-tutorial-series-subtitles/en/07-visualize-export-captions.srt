00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,460
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,660
In this part we are going to learn how to display your design

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,040
and finally save it into an embroidery format that your machine can read.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,280
Whenever you are running the params dialogue in Ink/Stitch you will see the simulator.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,220
This is very important while planing your design, since you can visually see the changes as you make them.

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,440
The simulator can also run without the params dialogue.

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,840
In the customize tutorial we created a shortcut to open it with Ctrl+Shift+L,

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,720
but this is a custom shortcut key and not available by default.

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,540
If you don't have the shortcut key set, open the simulator through "Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Simulator".

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,540
It will simulate selected objects, or - if none is selected - the whole design.

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:18,220
You can speed up and slow down the simulation with arrow up and arrow down or by using the corresponding buttons.

12
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,980
You can swith the playback to be backwards or forwards with arrow left or right.

13
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,600
Pause and restart the animation with the space bar.

14
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,620
Move the animation step by step with plus or minus.

15
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,880
Restart the animation with "R".

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,840
You can also grab the slider and move it to an other position

17
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,000
or jump to an specific point by entering a number.

18
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,680
You should pause the simulaton before doing so.

19
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,000
During the animation you can see the current speed in the status bar,

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,800
beside of the information if the current command is fe. a stitch, trim or stop command.

21
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,640
When you are done, close the simulator with "Q".

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,700
While the simulator is very useful, you sometimes will need to see a realistic preview of your design.

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,040
This way you can get a better impression of your stitch length settings, etc.

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,820
In Ink/Stitch you will have access to a realistic preview through the print function.

25
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,600
The print function will open in your default browser.

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,540
Run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Print".

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,960
The print sheet that you will see is meant to be used either by operator or customer.

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,880
But before we look into these options we want to discover the realistic preview.

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,780
Move your mouse over the embroidery image.

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,740
On the bottom of the canvas you will see different options to scale the design.

31
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,820
You can also hit Ctrl and scroll the mouse-wheel to scale it up and down.

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,100
With the left mouse button you can grab it and move it somewhere else.

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,260
"Fit" will scale the design to fit into the canvas.

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,920
100% will scale it to real size.

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,480
Once you are satisfied with scaling and position you can apply the transforms to all other pages where the design is displayed.

36
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:29,120
Finally we enable the "Realistic" checkbox. It may take a while before it is being displayed.

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,120
Now let's have a look into the other settings in the print sheet.

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Go to settings.

39
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,260
First you will see basic page setup options.

40
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,640
Depending on your country you will want to choose either "Letter" or "A4" paper format.

41
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,800
Then you have different layout options, depending on the purpose you want to use the print-out for.

42
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,680
The operator detailed view comes with an other option,

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,160
where you can define the size of the thumbnails through a slider.

44
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,300
In the branding tab you can change the page header logo.

45
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,280
And enter your contact information which will be displayed in the page footer.

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,240
Open the estimated time tab.

47
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:32,500
Here you can specify information about your machine and workflow to roughly calculate the time that will be needed to stitch out the design.

48
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,320
You might not want this information to be displayed on every layout type.

49
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,560
Disable those, where it shouldn't appear.

50
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,940
In the design tab you can change the thread palette.

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,260
If you used palettes while editing your design in Inkscape,

52
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,300
the print preview will already use these colors.

53
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,060
In other cases or if you want to change the displayed thread palette you can edit the setting here.

54
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,100
All colors in the design will be recalculated and previous changes will be lost.

55
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,660
Page Setup, Branding and Estimated Time settings can be saved as defaults and be used for every new design.

56
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,480
Close the settings dialogue and have a look to the page header.

57
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,560
You will see fields indicating that you can enter custom text.

58
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,540
So you can define a title for this particular design, enter the clients name and purchase order.

59
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,120
On detailed views you can also change the thread and color name manually.

60
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,260
The operator detailed view also has a field for custom notes for each thread.

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,340
When you are done with all settings use the print button.

62
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:10,040
You can print it with your printer, but in most cases you would want to print to PDF, so you can send the PDF-file to your customer or operator.

63
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:20,020
When everything is done, click on the close button to regain access to Inkscape, which has been locked while you were editing the print preview.

64
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,860
All settings you've made in the print preview will be saved into the SVG file,

65
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,100
so you don't have to do everything twice in case you want to change your design.

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,800
Embroider is an older function which has been very important before the simulator existed.

67
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,080
With the new functionality you will rarely be using it. But still there might be possible usecases.

68
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,000
Open "Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Embroider"

69
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,060
The dialogue comes with a few options.

70
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,400
You will want to set the output file format to one,

71
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,700
that your machine can read.

72
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,340
If you leave "Directory" empty,

73
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,340
the output file will be saved in the Inkscape's extensions directory.

74
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,360
You might want to change this. Enter a path.

75
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,260
When you hit "Apply" Ink/Stitch will perform two actions:

76
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,140
It will save an embroidery file on your computer

77
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:36,560
It will display the output in Inkscape - while hiding all other layers if the option was enabled in the embroider dialogue.

78
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,400
Now you can inspect and modify the output in Inkscape.

79
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,920
The so newly created path is a stroke with manual stitch placement enabled.

80
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:59,500
A more comfortable way to export to an embroidery file is to use the "File > Save as..." export function.

81
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,180
Here you can choose the file format for your machine.

82
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,020
All file format names start with Ink/Stitch, so you can easily find them in the list.

83
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,580
Enter the filename and click on "Save".

84
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,740
Don't forget to also save your design in the SVG file format,

85
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,660
just in case you want to perform changes at a later time.

86
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,200
You can also open embroidery files with Ink/Stitch.

87
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,260
Just right click on the file in your file browser and choose "Open with > Inkscape".

88
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,480
An other possibility would be to open Inkscape

89
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,900
and go to "File > Open...", choose your file in the dialgoue and click on "Open".

90
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,360
Imported embroidery files will be displayed as a stroke in manual stitch mode.

91
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,300
For certain file formats like "dst" colors may vary from your expectations,

92
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,440
because they cannot save color information.

93
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,880
We hope you enjoyed the tutorial. Now you have seen all the Ink/Stitch functions.

94
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,540
In the next video we will demonstrate a typical workflow and put all the pieces together.
