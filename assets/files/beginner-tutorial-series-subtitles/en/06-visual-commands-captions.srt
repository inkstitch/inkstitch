00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,760
In this tutorial are we going to talk about visual commands.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,740
Visual commands are used to give Ink/Stitch additional information about the way how your design should be stitched out.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,940
Before you can use visual commands you need to run "Install add-ons for Inkscape" in order to make the symbols accessible.

5
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,180
There are three types of commands:

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,240
Commands which effect the entire design

7
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,860
Commands which effect the selected layer

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Commands which influence selected objects

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:00,820
In "Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Commands > Add commands ..." you will find two options.

10
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,940
"Stop position" will define a point where your machine will jump to, before every stop command.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,740
This allows for pushing the embroidery frame out towards the user, to make applique steps easier.

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,360
The Origin specifies the zero point for embroidery files.

13
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:35,760
Setting up origins is especially useful for people that have full access to the entire sewing field that their machine is capable of, regardless of what hoop they use.

14
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,120
"Add Layer commands..." has only one option:

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,160
"Ignore Layer" can be used to ignore an entire layer when converting to an embroidery file.

16
00:01:52,660 --> 00:02:03,760
This can be useful if you want to add extra information into the file, f.e. tutorial instructions - or if you temporarily want to exclude a part of your design.

17
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,920
"Attach commands to selected objects..." will add information to selected objects.

18
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,820
For fill stitching we can define starting and ending positions.

19
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,860
Select a fill object and enable "starting position for fill" and "Ending position for fill".

20
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Click apply and move the symbols to the desired position.

21
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,920
The effect will be performed where the connector crosses the outline of the shape.

22
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,280
As for fills you can also define start and end positions for auto-route satin.

23
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,100
Select the first satin column and add the "auto-route starting position"-command.

24
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,840
Select the last satin column and add the "auto-route ending position"-command.

25
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Move the symbol to the right place

26
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,960
and run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Satin Tools > Auto-route satin"

27
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,660
For satin columns there is also a split functionality.

28
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:25,080
This is useful if you want to split a satin column while keeping all settings that you have previously made while modifying the path.

29
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,580
With the satin column selected add a "Split satin column"-command.

30
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,200
Move the symbol and run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Satin Tools > Cut Satin Column"

31
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,040
This will split your satin column at the predefined position.

32
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,020
The "Trim"-command can be applied to any embroidery shape.

33
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,000
It will tell the machine to trim the thread after sewing this object.

34
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:04,080
The "Stop" or "Pause" command will cause the machine to move into the position which you have previously defined through the "stop position"-command.

35
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,340
And is therefor useful especially for applique designs.

36
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,440
It can be applied to any object as well.

37
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,000
Objects with an "ignore"-command will be ignored in the embroidery output.

38
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:57,180
It might happen though, that some machines will ignore certain commands like e.g. the trim command.

39
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,340
Not every machine is capable to follow these instructions.

40
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:08,140
We hope this tutorial was useful for you and helps you to gain more control over the embroidery output.
