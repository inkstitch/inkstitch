    To define which line will be stitched in which color, we will loop through the color sections
    defined by the stop positions of the gradient (stop_color_line_indices).
    Each section will then be subdivided into smaller sections using the square root of the total line number
    of the whole section. Lines left over from this operation will be added step by step to the smaller sub-sections.
    Since we do this symmetrically we may end one line short, which we an add at the end.

    Now we define the line colors of the first half of our color section, we will later mirror this on the second half.
    Therefor we use one additional line of color2 in each sub-section and position them as evenly as possible between the color1 lines.
    Doing this we take care, that the number of consecutive lines of color1 is always decreasing.

    For example let's take a 12 lines sub-section, with 5 lines of color2.
    12 / 5 = 2.4
    12 % 5 = 2
    This results into the following pattern:
    xx|xx|x|x|x| (while x = color1 and | = color2).
    Note that the first two parts have an additional line (as defined by the modulo operation)

    Method returns
    color_lines: A dictionary with lines grouped by color
    colors:      An updated list of color values.
