## Satin guided ripple stitch Hummingbird  

Each feather is a satin guided ripple stitch

![Using one single varigated thread for the feathes](/assets/images/tutorials/tutorial-preview-images/ripple_satin_humming_bird_monochrom.jpg)


Two sample files: the first one uses a single thread for all the feathers, the second one uses three colors of threads.

The order of embroidery is different in the files to ensure correct overlapping of the feathers and as few jump stitches as possible.
