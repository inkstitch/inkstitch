A hoop that can be made with a CNC laser cutter or CNC router.  A laser cutter
can be used on steel and the router can be used on 2mm thick steel or 3mm thick
AlucoBond.

The hoop should fit in a wide range of commercial embroidery machines, though
you may need to adjust the dimensions for your embroidery machine.

There are many fabrication service providers that can do the CNC cutting for you,
some can be found online. Send them the file in an appropriate form and agree
on the material to be cut. You may need to open the svg files in Inkscape and
export them in a format the CNC machine operator can use, this could be pdf, eps
or dxf (version 14 is best for curves). Once you receive the cut parts, obtain 8
Neodymium magnets with a diameter of 8mm and a height of 4mm.

Glue all the pieces together using epoxy. Steel can also be spot welded, though
magnets need to be attached using epoxy.
