## Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

**In this part we are going to install Ink/Stitch on your computer.**

Although the installation process is quiet similar on the various operating systems, you might prefer watching the video corresponding to yours.

**Windows:** You find the tutorials for Linux and MacOS in the description below. This is the tutorial for Windows users.

**Linux:** You find the tutorials for Windows and MacOS in the description below. This is the tutorial for Linux users.

**macOS:** You find the tutorials for Windows and Linux in the description below. This is the tutorial for MacOS users.

## Requirements

Let's start with the requirements.

1.  Ink/Stitch is an Inkscape plugin. Which means you definitely need to have Inkscape installed.

    Any version is fine, but we recommend to have at least version 0.92.2 installed, because it comes with new features that are essential to organize the stitching order of your design.

    You can download Inkscape for free on their website at <https://inkscape.org><br>
    **Linux:** or install it directly through your distributions repositories.

2.  Ink/Stitch uses a web-browser to create print-out information sheets for both, operator and customer. You might also enjoy this feature, because it optionally displays a realistic preview of your design.

    To be able to use this feature you will need a modern HTML5 capable browser, which you will most likely have already installed since you are watching this tutorial.

3.  All other dependencies are delivered by the Ink/Stitch plugin itself. Which makes the installation fairly easy.

## Installation

* To get the latest Ink/Stitch release for your operating system visit <https://inkstitch.org>

  **Windows:** Click on "Download Ink/Stitch" and save the archive with win32 in its filename.

  **Linux:** Click on "Download Ink/Stitch" and save the archive with linux_64 in its filename. It will work on 64bit systems only.

  **macOS:** Click on "Download Ink/Stitch" and save the archive with osx_64 in its filename.

* In Inkscape go to Edit > Preferences > System and check where your user extensions folder is located.
* Decompress the Ink/Stitch archive directly into the extensions folder.

And that's it. You already did all the steps necessary in order to install Ink/Stitch.

## Testrun

Now let's check if Ink/Stitch is actually working.

*   Restart Inkscape

*   You will find the extension under Extensions > Ink/Stitch

*   Draw a shape and convert it to a path

*   With the newly created path selected run "Params". Beside of the params dialogue you will see a simulation which will update as you change the values.
