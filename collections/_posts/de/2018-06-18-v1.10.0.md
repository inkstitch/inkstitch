**Changelog:**

This version adds an exciting new feature: File -> Save Copy support to
directly save your design in machine format (PES, DST, etc).  Better still,
you can save as an Ink/Stitch ZIP file.  Ink/Stitch will export your design
in your selected machine formats and zip it all together, ready for sale
as a stock design.

In order to use the new output extensions, you'll need to restart Inkscape
after you install this version.
