The Inkscape community has kindly set up two places where Ink/Stitch users can connect, a forum and a chat channel.

If you are new to Ink/Stitch, these spaces are a friendly way to ask questions and get help with your first steps. If you already feel comfortable, you can support new stitchers, swap tips, connect with developers, and keep up with new and advanced features.

Whatever brings you here, we would love to meet you and hear what you are working on.
