## Using Ink/Stitch

### Ink/Stitch is creating zig-zag lines instead of running stitch

![Running Stitch Dashes](/assets/images/docs/running-stitch-dashes.jpg){: .align-right style="padding: 5px"}
Make sure you follow the [running stitch instructions](/docs/stitches/running-stitch/).

You are most likely using a continuous stroke instead of a dashed stroke.

### Guideline Origin isn't working!

The guideline method for setting the origin (0,0) is **deprecated**.

Use [**visual commands**](/docs/commands) instead:
* Go to `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Commands > Add Commands …` and choose `Origin`
* Place the symbol ![origin](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-origin.jpg) where you like the origin to be.

### Receiving Error Messages

Search through the [error messages](/docs/error-messages) and see if the description has useful information for you.
