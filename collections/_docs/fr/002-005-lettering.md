The lettering tool generates multi-line text as satin columns and dynamically routes stitching, breaking up satins if necessary and adding running stitch.

![Lettering Extensions](/assets/images/docs/lettering.jpg)

## Usage

* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Lettering`
* Enter your text (multi-line is possible)
* Set font and scaling
* Click on `Apply and Quit`

## Options

* **Stitch lines of text back and forth**<br>
  With this option enabled the first line will be stitched from left to right and the second from right to left, etc.
  This will give your machine shorter ways to travel.

* **Add trims**<br>
  With this option enabled Ink/Stitch will add TRIM-commands for each letter.

## Presets

You can save and load your favourite font settings.
