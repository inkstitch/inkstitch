Ink/Stitch can install files ("add-ons") that make it easier to use Inkscape to create machine embroidery designs.

**Add-ons to be installed**
* [thread manufacturer color palettes](/docs/addons/#thread-manufacturer-color-palettes)
* [Ink/Stitch visual commands (Objects -> Symbols ...)](/docs/addons/#visual-commands)

**Install**
* Go to `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Install add-ons for Inkscape`
* Click `Install`
* Restart Inkscape

**Manual Install**
* *Palettes*: Copy extension files from `inkstitch > palettes` folder to your Inkscape palettes folder. E.g. in Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/palettes`.
* *Visual Commands*:Copy extension files from `inkstitch > symbols` folder to your Inkscape symbols folder. E.g. in Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/symbols`.

## Thread Manufacturer Color Palettes

Inkscape palettes are found on the bottom to the right of the color swatches.

Click on the little arrow to open a list of installed palettes and choose the manufacturer color palette depending on the thread you are willing to use.

The choice will also take effect on the thread names to appear in the print preview.

## Visual commands

Visual Commands are used to give Ink/Stitch additional information about the way your design should be stitched out. E.g. to place the designs origin (0/0) or to define where your fill stitch should start to render, etc.
