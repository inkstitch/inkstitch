## Installing Ink/Stitch

### I have downloaded and unzipped the [latest release](https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/releases/latest). Where do I put it?

In Inkscape open: `Edit > Preferences > System` and check the paths for extensions.

You should preferably install in **USER EXTENSIONS**, since this will make it easier to update later.

If you have any diacritics in your username, try the **INKSCAPE EXTENSIONS** path if you are having trouble running Ink/Stitch.

### My Ink/Stitch dosen't run!

*   **Confirm installation path**<br>
    Check if files were possibly extracted into a *sub-directory*.
    You should see a lot of files starting with "inkstitch" **directly** inside the extension folder, beside of one folder called "inkstitch".

*   **Username with diacritics**<br>
    Read [where to copy your files](/docs/faq/#i-have-downloaded-and-unzipped-the-latest-release-where-do-i-put-it)

*   **Windows Anti-Virus**<br>
    This is more prone to happen in Windows, since the python is packed into a executable there are reports of anti-virus-software using heuristics
    that mark the extension as a false positive. The solution in this cases is to add the Ink/Stitch extension folder to the exception list on the
    av program reinstall the extension and try again.

    There are user reports [#118](https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/issues/118) from windows users that the extension may have trouble with paths that have special characters.

## Using Ink/Stitch

### Ink/Stitch is creating zig-zag lines instead of running stitch

![Running Stitch Dashes](/assets/images/docs/running-stitch-dashes.jpg){: .align-right style="padding: 5px"}
Make sure you follow the [running stitch instructions](/docs/stitches/running-stitch/).

You are most likely using a continuous stroke instead of a dashed stroke.

### Guideline Origin isn't working!

The guideline method for setting the origin (0,0) is **deprecated**.

Use [**visual commands**](/docs/commands) instead:
* Go to `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Commands > Add Commands …` and choose `Origin`
* Place the symbol ![origin](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-origin.jpg) where you like the origin to be.
