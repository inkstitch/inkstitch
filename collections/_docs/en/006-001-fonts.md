## Ink/Stitch lettering tool

Ink/Stitch includes a lettering tool that creates embroidery ready text with optimized stitch routing. This tool is designed for common lettering use cases and helps reduce manual setup when adding text to a design.

If you want to create custom fonts for use with the lettering tool, see the [tutorial on digitizing fonts for Ink/Stitch](/tutorials/font-creation/).

## Digitizing fonts

Creating embroidery fonts requires careful planning and practice, though it provides a solid way to learn core digitizing concepts such as stitch direction, density, and pull compensation.

Most embroidery fonts rely on [satin columns](/docs/stitches/satin-column/) because they produce clean edges and good visual definition. For very large lettering, a combination approach often works better, using a fill stitch for the interior with a satin column border around the edges.

Font selection plays a major role in stitch quality. Satin stitches become difficult to manage when column widths are 1 mm or less. Sans serif fonts are usually easier to digitize and stitch consistently. For text smaller than 4 mm in height, lowercase letters often lose clarity, so block capitals tend to produce better results. Cursive or script fonts can look appealing, though they typically require more adjustment and testing than simpler font styles.
