## What it is

Zig-Zag stitches are a very basic option to create a simple zig-zag line.

## How to Create

Zig-Zag stitches can be created by using a **continuous line** (without dashes).

Ink/Stitch will create stitches along the path using the **stroke width** you specified.

Go to `Object > Fill and Stroke...` and set the desired stroke width in the `Stroke style` tab.

Further stitch details can be managed via [`Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Params`](/docs/params/#stroke-params).

## Tips:

### Satin Column: A Better Option

It is not recommended to use the Zig-Zag Stitch Mode to create a satin border, use [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin-column/) instead.

Ink/Stitch will plot zig-zags to the left and right of the line from start to end, but it won’t do anything special around curves and corners. Sharper curves and corners will result in sparse stitching around the outside of the curve and dense stitching around the inside. This won’t look good and may even poke holes in the insides of corners.

### The Zig-Zag Stroke Width Issue

You may discover that the stroke width fails if the viewbox has different scaling for X and Y - or the object or any of its parent groups has a `transform` attribute set (which can easliy happen if you resize a group in Inkscape).

Use [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin-column/) instead.
