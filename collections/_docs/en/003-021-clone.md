## What it is

Ink/Stitch supports Inkscape's [clones](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloning-objects.html).
Any changes that are made to the params of an element will automatically be applied to all of the clones of that element.
This can be a powerful tool for designs that have repeated shapes or elements that should be stitched in a similar way.

By default, Clones automatically adjust the fill angles of any elements they clone.
If a clone is rotated or flipped, its stitch angle will also be rotated or flipped to match.

If you want to unlink clones, you should use [Ink/Stitch's unlink clone command](/docs/edit/#unlink-clone) instead of Inkscape's built-in unlink clone command.
Ink/Stitch's unlink clone command applies fill angle transforms and ensures commands attached to clones are properly copied.

## How to Create

In Inkscape, select the element or group of elements that you want to clone, and click `Edit > Clone > Create Clone` or use the shortcut `Alt+D`.
The clone can be moved, rotated, or scaled. Any changes made to the original object will be reflected in its clones.

## Params

Cloned stitch elements use the stitching parameters of the original object(s) that they clone. 
By default, the stitch angles of cloned fill objects will be rotated as above.

However, clones themselves have a couple of additional parameters that may be useful.
Select the clone(s), but not the original object(s), and run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` to tweak these settings to your needs.


Settings||Description
---|---|---
Custom Fill Angle||If set, all of the fill elements in this clone will use this value for their fill angle, instead of being based off of the transform as above.
Flip Angle||Flip the fill angles of the cloned elements. This option is mainly here for backwards compatibility.
