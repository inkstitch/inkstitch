Try the following steps to learn the basic functionality of Ink/Stitch.  

**Tip:** If you are new to Inkscape, you may want to review the [Basic Inkscape Tutorial](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html) before you begin.

## Step 1 - Draw an Object

1. Create an object, for example a circle, and confirm it has a fill color.
2. If you do not know what fill means, please review the[Basic Inkscape Tutorial](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html)

## Step 2 - Parametrize SVG Path for Embroidery

1. Select the object.
2. Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params`.  This will launch the extension in another window. 
3. Adjust the values.  The simulator updates when you change the settings.
4. Close the window without saving for now.

**Note:** If you do not see a tab at the top of the Ink/Stitch window named `FillStitch`, you have either not selected an object that has fill or you have not selected an object that is a path. You will need to convert your object to a path.  {: .notice--info}

## Step 3 - Create the embroidery file

1. From the Inkscape menu, select `File > Save a copy...`
2. Select to the folder where you would like to save the file
3. Choose the correct file format for your machine
4. Click `Save`.  You can now copy to the file to your machine for use. 

**Tip:** Save the file as an SVG file as well so that you can modify it later.
