Try the following steps to learn the basic functionality of Ink/Stitch.  

**Tip:** If you are new to Inkscape, you may want to review the [Basic Inkscape Tutorial](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html) before you begin.

## Step 1 - Draw an Object

1. Create an object, for example a circle, and confirm it has a fill color.
2. If you do not know what fill means, please review the [Basic Inkscape Tutorial](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html)

## Step 2 - Parametrize SVG Path for Embroidery

1. Select the object.
2. Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params`.  This will launch the extension in another window. 
3. Adjust the values.  The simulator updates the preview when you change the settings.
4. Close the window without saving.

**Note:** If you do not see a tab at the top of the Ink/Stitch window named `FillStitch`, you have either not selected an object that has fill or you have not selected an object that is a path. You will need to convert your object to a path.

## Step 3 - Create the embroidery file

1. From the Inkscape menu, select `File > Save a copy...`
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to save the file
3. Choose the correct file format for your machine
4. Select `Save a copy`.  You can now copy the file to your machine for use. 

**Tip:** Save the file as an SVG so that you can modify it later.

If the steps above worked well, continue to the next page about Workflow. It is a deeper look at Ink/Stitch and explains how to perform important tasks for preparing embroidery files, such as ordering objects and managing the stitch sequences.
