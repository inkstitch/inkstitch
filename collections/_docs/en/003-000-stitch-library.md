A stitch type explains how Ink/Stitch converts paths and shapes into embroidery. Each stitch type creates a distinct texture, thickness, and level of coverage. The selection influences the appearance of outlines, lettering, and filled areas on fabric, shaping both the visual style and the overall feel of the finished embroidery.

## Stroke Stitches

Stroke stitches can be used for outlines, line art or to add small details.

### Running Stitch

Running stitch creates small stitches that follow a line (path).

### Zig-Zag Stitch

Zigzag stitch creates running stitches that stitch back and forth. It works best on straight lines, since corners and tight curves stitch poorly. For most designs, a satin column is a better choice.

## Satin

### Satin Column

Satin stitch is used for borders, letters or small fill areas.

A satin column is created using a zigzag stitch between two boundary lines. The distance between those lines controls the column width, which gives you flexibility to adjust how thin or bold the stitch appears on the fabric.

### E-Stitch

E-stitch is a simple but strong stitch used to hold appliques. Because this is not as thick of a stitch (unlike satin) it is often used for baby clothes as their skin tends to be more sensitive.

Cross stitch mimics traditional hand embroidery techniques. Cross-stitch is characterized by small, even crosses, which give the embroidered image a flat, blockish look.
