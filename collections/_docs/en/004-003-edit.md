* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Edit > Duplicate Params`

## Generate Test Swatches from Selection

This extension allows to easily test different values for embroidery parameters by creating test swatches.

### Usage

* Select an element you want to create test swatches for 
* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Edit> Generate Test Swatches from selection`
* Select one parameter , its initial value and the increment step.  Choose the number of rows and columns and the spacing for swatches placement on the canvas.

If you want to test different values for two parameters, you can create all the swatches for the first parameter with  a single row and multiple columns , then select all the swatches, run again the extension, select a different parameter and create the new swatches with multiple rows and a single column.

You can of course keep going with more parameters.

## Remove duplicated points

{% include upcoming_release.html %}

Removes duplicated nodes within a given distance range and number of consecutive nodes.

Can be used to turn a bean stitch line from a stitch plan into a simple line.

### Usage

* Select stroke(s)
* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Edit > Remove duplicated points`
* Change settings as desired
* Apply

## Re-stack objects in order of selection

This tool will take away a lot of work when you are about to reorder your objects for a better routing. Instead of moving your objects in the object panel one by one, perform the following steps:

* Select elements in the order you want them to be stitched out
* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Edit> Re-stack objects in order of selection`

Ink/Stitch will then reorder your elements as you selected them. First selected element will be placed in the lowest position of your object panel (which means it will be stitched out first).

**Warning**: If you select elements from different groups or layers, they will be placed in the same group afterwards. Which can lead to a different placement of some elements if one or both group elements have a transformation.

## Selection to anchor line

[More about patterns](/docs/stitches/patterns/)

## Select embroidery elements

Sometimes you will want to select all elements of a specific embroidery type (for example a satin column with a centerwalk underlay). This extension is able to do this for you.

### Usage

* If you do not want to select all elements in the document, but only from a smaller area, select a bunch of elements and the extension will deselect those elements which do not fit the selection rules.
* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Select embroidery elements...`
* Select the stitch types you want to select and click `Apply`

**macOS**: This won't work for macOS users unless they install dbus manually.

**Info**: Sometimes this extension may fail the first time you run it. Hit the apply button a second time and you may have more luck.

### Troubleshoot

If this isn't working for you, you may need to insert your path to a python executable manualy.
