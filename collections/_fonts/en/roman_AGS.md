## Using the two fonts together

Whenever a glyph is present in both fonts, the design shape and size of the glyphs are exactly the same. It is therefore very easy to use them together:

- Do a lettering of the whole text unsing Roman AGS only
- Do a letterng using  Roman AGS bicolore with only the letters you wish to be bicolors.
- Put each bicolor letter exactly on top of the corresponding monocolor letter  
- Hide those monocolor letters
