## Special Feature

![Dimensions Glacialtiny](/assets/images/fonts/Sizing/glacialsizing.jpg)

This font is very very tiny.

Such a tinyness is only possible because it is meant to be used with both very thin needles (USA size 8, EUr size 60) and very thin thread (60wt).
Do not use the regular 40wt embroidery thread.

If you do not follow these recommendations, you will probably have lots of embroidering problems.
