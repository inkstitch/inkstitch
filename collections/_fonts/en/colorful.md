## Too much work ?

Each letter has its own tartan, therefore embroidering it as is, is not for the faint of heart ! Quite a few threads changes are required. However for a less work intense (but also less colorful) variation with only one tartan shared by all leters (or only a few tartans, each shared by several letters) see [this](https://inkstitch.org//fr/tutorials/make_tartan_font_easier/)
