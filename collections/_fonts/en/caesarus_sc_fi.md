# Glyphes

This font contains  {{ font.glyphs.size }} glyphs:

```
{{ font.glyphs | sort | join: ' ' }}
```
{: .font-glyphs }

Note that lower cases are actually small caps.

## Dimensions

At 100%, this font is approximatively 30 mm (1 1/4 inch) high.

It can be scaled up to 200% (approx. 40 mm, 2.5 inches) or scaled down to 70% (approx. 21 mm, 0.8 inch).

The embroidering parameters allow you to scale up further, but then too long stitches are avoided by spliting the satin stitches you may or not like the effect.
