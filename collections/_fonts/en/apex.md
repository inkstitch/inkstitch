## Special features

Apex Lake est quite a large ornemental font. Each letter comes with a square frame.

If you do not wish to embroider the frame, skip the last two colors.

If you wish to use the frame for an appliqué, use a copy of the penultimate path to stitch your fabric.

In order to avoid messy overlays, the background pattern is incomplete in most of the letters. However would you wish to use it as a decoration, you can find it complete in the J cap.

Apex Lake and Apex Simple work well together, usually using  Apex Lake pour the first letter and Apex Simple AGS for the leftover:
![Both_Apex](/assets/images/fonts/both_apex.png)

Contrarily to Apex Simple, Apex Simple Small font MUST be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual. A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread MUST be used.
