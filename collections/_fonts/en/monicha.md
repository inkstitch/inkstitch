## Special Features

Monicha is our first font with alternative characters.

For instance, these are different ways to write the firstname Sasha.

### The parentheses

The two usual parentheses ( and ) are binded to 
![monica parentheses](/assets/images/fonts/monicha/monicaparentheses.png)

Monicha contains also one more alternative versions of the letters a-z and A-Z.

**However, some restrictions on the use of these alternative letters should be observed to avoid overlapping satin columns.**

### How to access the alternative letters

There are four alternative letter families: alt1, alt2, alt3, and alt4.

For example, you'll get two alternative versions of the name Sasha by typing in the lettering
(Sash.alt2a.alt3) (i.e., S a s h.alt2 a.alt3 - but don't type the spaces) or Sa.alt3sh.alt3a.alt1

#### alt1: Small swashes

All lowercase letters have a small swash version that works particularly well on the last letter of a word.

In the lettering, for example, type a.alt1 instead of a if you want to use this alternative version of a.

#### alt2: Curly swashes : b-d-h-k-l-t i-j-o-r-y

The rising letters (b-d-h-k-l-t) have an alternative version with a backward curly upper swash. The two preceding letters can not be a capital letter or another rising letter.

The alternative versions of i, j, r, and y have a backward curly low swash. They must not, on two letters, be followed by a descending letter (d-g-p-q-y-z).

Exceptions to the restrictions: The image above also shows ligatures that have been added to the font: **l&l.alt2 r&i.alt2 t&h.alt2 t&t.alt2**

#### alt3: Long  or Medium Underscore a-c-d-e-h-i-k-l-m-n-o-r-t-u g-j-y

Letters with an underscore must not be followed by a descending letter or another letter with an underscore. For long underscores, the prohibition extends to the following two letters.

<img src="/assets/images/fonts/monicha/alt3.png" alt="Medium Scarf Underlining" title="Medium Scarf Underlining"><br>

Exceptions to the restrictions: The image above also shows ligatures that have been added to the font: **a&f.alt3 a&g.alt3 a&j.alt3**

### alt4: Heart at the beginning for upper case letters, heart at the end for lowercase letters.

These alternative upper case letters should only be used at the beginning of a word, and lowercase letters only at the end.
