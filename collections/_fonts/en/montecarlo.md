## How to use the alternate glyphs
As you can see in the Glyph list above, {{ page.title }} contains a lot of alternate  glyphs. 
To use them, simply type their full name (as it appears in the glyph list, don't use the <key>Alt</key>) in the lettering tool.

For instance, M has 4 alternates. Typing "M.alt3" will show you one of them. Typing "M.alt5" will show you that M.alt5 not being in the glyphs list  renders as "M.alt5".

Not every alternate can be used everywhere. Best is to use the lettering tool simulator to check if the alternates glyphs do not conflict with the rest of text

You can also use the 'begin', 'end', 'swash' and 'swoop' glyphs (and their alternates) to add some flourish around your text.
