## Remarks

This is a font for the visually impaired with Braille key combinations according to DT 2024 INSEI specifications for French 6 dots Braille. 

It is also possible to use Unicode Braille. In this case, it is convenient to use one of the web's Braille translators to create a text in Braille unicode.
