## How to use them

### Kum Tsoan  AGS

Kum Tsoan AGS is  an appliqué font:

* First color (red) is a placement stitch
* Add your fabric to cover  the placement stitch
* Second color (green) is a tack down
* Cut  the excess of fabric after stitching the second color
* Third color (black) stitches the satin  columns

### Kum Tsoan Relief

As is, Kum Tsoan Relief is to be used this way :

*  hoop some lining fabric
* embroider the first color (red). It is a positioning running stitch which indicates where to place the foam to obtain a relief effect.
* place the foam on top and then embroider the second color (green): this triple stitch will cut out the foam.
* remove excess foam and install the “final” fabric.
*  embroider the last color (blue): A quintuple stitch is embroidered around the letters.

If you embroider several letters, it is possible to color sort. [Here is a way to do it](/docs/lettering/#color-sorting)

If you remove the stroke color from the green paths and replace it with a fill color, you can also use the font in the following way:
* hoop the final fabric with the stabilizer.
* embroider the fill stitches(for example a tartan filling or a linear gradient filling).
* tape the foam to the back of the stabilizer.
* embroider the second color (red): this triple stitch will cut the foam.
* remove excess foam and place a liner under the foam.
* embroider the last color (blue): A quintuple stitch is embroidered around the letters, sandwiching the foam between the lining and the final fabric.

[More details (in  French) on using this font can be found here.](https://lyogau.over-blog.com/2024/06/broderie-en-relief-mousse-puffy-ou-autre.html)

###  Kum Tsoan Tartan

Kum Tsoan Tartan is a  tartan font. Each letter has its own tartan, therefore embroidering it as is is not for the faint of heart ! Quite a few threads changes are required. However for a less work intense (but also less colorful) variation with only one tartan shared by all leters, see  [this](https://inkstitch.org//fr/tutorials/make_tartan_font_easier/)
