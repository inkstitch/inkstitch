## Dimensions

At 100%, this font is approximatively 20 mm (0.8 inch).

![Dimensions Pacificlo](/assets/images/fonts/Sizing/pacificlosizing.jpg)

Don't try to scale it further down.

Pacificlo tiny is a variation of this font with different embroidery settings. Pull compensation, density and underlays are different to allow to scale down between 55% (11 mm, 0.4 inch) and 25% (5mm ,1/5 inch). 

That's why in the lettering dialog window, if using Pacificlo tiny, you will have to pick up a scale between 25 and 55%. 

Contrarily to Pacificlo, Pacificlo tiny font **MUST** be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual.
A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread **MUST** be used.
