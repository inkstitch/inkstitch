## [v1.7.1: Merge pull request #162 from lexelby/lexelby-fix-palette-crash](https://github.com/lexelby/inkstitch/releases/tag/v1.7.1) ##

* handle case where no palette is used

## v1.7.0: enhanced printing and thread manufacturer palettes ##

* thread palettes
  * new extension to install Inkscape palettes for many manufacturers' thread catalogs
  * Print extension uses thread names from the palette you chose
    * (you can override the palette if necessary)
* more print-out customization
  * set names for threads
  * add operator notes for each color block
  * choose your own branding icon
  * drag and zoom stitch previews
* print-out customizations saved into the SVG
  * certain settings can also be saved as global defaults
* deprecated 0.5px running stitch
  * previously, a stroke width of 0.5px told Ink/Stitch to use running stitch
  * this still works but results in a deprecation warning
  * instead, set a dashed stroke to signify running stitch
    * any kind of dashes will do
